# communicating-uncertain-beliefs-conditionals

This repository accompanies our submission "Communicating uncertain beliefs with conditionals" to the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society 2021.

# Experiment

The code for the experiment is directly stored in "blockwords", the code 
for generation of the stimuli, and the stimuli pictures, are stored in "blockwords-main/stimuli".

The Experiment is implemented with [Magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html), open "blockwords/index.html" for running the experiment in a browser.

# Model 

To run webppl-model, run "blockwords-main/model/R/run-model.R", select the priors to be used here (as indicated in the script). 
Model configuration parameters are stored in "blockwords-main/model/config.yml" and 
model predictions are saved in a subdirectory of "blockwords-main/model/results", 
depending on the priors used.
The code for the webppl-model is to be found in "blockwords-main/model/webppl-model",
regression models in "blockwords-main/model/R/regression_models.R".

# Data

All data is stored in "blockwords-main/data", the data filtered by the criteria 
specified in the paper, is stored in the subdirectory  "filtered_data".


# Results / Plots

All Figures are generated by the script "blockwords-main/R/figures-paper.R"" which saves
them under "blockwords-main/data/prolific/blockwords/filtered_data/plots/".
