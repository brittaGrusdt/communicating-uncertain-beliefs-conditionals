for example:

const introView = intro({

for example:

The data is a list of objects defined in your local js file.

_magpie's trial views expect each trial object to have specific properties. Here is an example of a forcedCoice view trial:

{
    question: 'How are you today?',
    option1: 'fine',
    option2: 'good'
}

Btw, you can manually change the canvas size by passing 'canvasSettings' to the canvas object,
however, your canvas settings might be overridden if needed.
